Graduate Rotational Internship Program Tasks
I have completed my Task Assignments as a Data Science and analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation
I have done 2 tasks on Iris Dataset -
1. Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms 
2. Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms (predict the optimum number of clusters)
3. Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically)
