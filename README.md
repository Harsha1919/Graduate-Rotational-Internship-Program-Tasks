Graduate Rotational Internship Program Tasks
I have completed my Task Assignments as a Data Science and analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation
I have done some tasks on Iris Datasets and on students performance -
1. Task#1 : Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms 
2. Task#2 : Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms (predict the optimum number of clusters)
3. Task#3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically)
